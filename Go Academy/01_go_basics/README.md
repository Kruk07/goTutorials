1. Design and create data types and functions that will store movie characters in memory and provide CRUD operations on such memory database.
 
Entities: Movie (title, year), Character (movie, name).
Functional requirments: Provide CRUD operations on entities, list all movies, list all given movie characters.

2. Create simple web application using Uber FX (following Uber FX documentation) that will expose endpoints allowing to execute functional requirements from previous project (no need to validate data or return responses - results can be printed to the console; no need to take care about concurrency issues - race conditions).
